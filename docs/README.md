## About the Project

<img style="float: right;" src="img/declutter.jpg" width="200">

Did you ever want to declutter your Google Calendar? Or get rid of old and irrelevant calendar events?

You probably realised that neither the Google Calendar App nor the Website offer the functionality to batch delete multiple events at once. After deleting more than 100 events from my calendar by hand, I decided to automate the process and create this CLI to take of this process.


* **Build with: (Python, Typer, Google-Api-Python-Client)**

## My Todos (not part of the readme)

* More descriptive package name -> gcal-cli - it is not a general CLI
    * declutter-gcal ?
